## 💡 What is `green-squares-bot`?

Welcome to **green-squares-bot** — a simple yet creative bot that automatically generates commits to make your GitHub contribution graph colorful and active 🌱.

This is a **demo project** that showcases how you can use **GitHub Actions** to automate routine tasks, like generating commits on a schedule. It’s a great way to explore GitHub automation, scheduled workflows (via CRON), and Git operations — all within a lightweight and transparent project.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔁 **Automated Commits on 3–5 Random Days per Week**  
  Each week, the bot picks 3 to 5 random days (including weekends) to commit.

- 🔢 **Multiple Commits per Day**  
  Generates between **3 to 15 commits** on each commit day, with natural variation.

- 🕒 **Runs Three Times Daily**  
  Scheduled runs spread throughout the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) to simulate organic activity.

- 🧠 **Human-like Commit Messages and Quotes**  
  Uses randomly selected inspirational quotes and emojis to simulate real development habits.

- 📜 **Commit History Logging**  
  Logs all commits in `commit_log.txt` for transparency and tracking.

- 🧪 **Educational Use Only**  
  Designed as a learning tool for GitHub Actions, automation, and CI/CD workflows.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This project uses a `commit.py` Python script executed through a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/activity.yml`).

The workflow runs daily at three times:

- 🌅 **Morning:** `06:00 UTC` (11:30 AM IST)  
- 🌞 **Afternoon:** `12:00 UTC` (5:30 PM IST)  
- 🌙 **Evening:** `15:45 UTC` (9:15 PM IST)  

Each run performs:

1. 🧾 Git checkout  
2. ⚙️ Git identity setup  
3. 🎲 Weekly randomization of 3–5 commit days  
4. ✍️ Running `commit.py` to generate 3–15 commits on commit days  
5. 🗂️ Updating random files with quotes and messages  
6. 🔄 Pull latest changes with rebase  
7. 📤 Push commits if ahead

Automating your GitHub activity can be a **fun and informative** way to learn about CI/CD, bots, scripting, and workflows — but it's important to use this responsibly:

- Be **transparent** in your usage  
- Avoid **spammy or misleading behavior**  
- Present it clearly as a **testbed for learning automation**
